CS6038/CS5138 Malware Analysis
[Department of Electrical Engineering and Computing Systems](https://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/)  
[College of Engineering and Applied Science](https://ceas.uc.edu)  
[University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu)  
**Meets every Tue/Thu in 3210 RECCENTER @ 4:00PM-5:20PM**  

**Want to participate?**: [Apply to Graduate School Here](https://eecs.ceas.uc.edu/graduate/admissions-application)

This class will introduce the CS graduate students to malware concepts, malware analysis,
and black-box reverse engineering techniques. The target audience is focused on *computer
science* graduate students or undergraduate seniors without prior cyber security or
malware experience. It is intended to introduce the students to types of malware, common
attack recipes, some tools, and a wide array of malware analysis techniques.

In general, if you've taken the following courses, you should have a good foundation for
the class:  
CS4029/6029 - Operating Systems  
CS2029 - Data Structures

As virtualization is a key ingredient to any malware analysis, students are expected to
have access to a laptop which can run multiple virtual machines at a time, with adequate
CPU, RAM, and available disk storage. The minimum configuration expected to work well is
a system with 4 cores (4 or 8 threads), 16GB of RAM and at least 150GB of free space on
disk. Lesser configurations may work, but will likely increase the amount of wait time,
minimized multitasking, and generally add to frustration.

### Explore By Topic
Here are a list of topics that I have done lectures on, feel free to explore the content
